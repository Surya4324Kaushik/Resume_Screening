# Resume_Screening_App
This is a Resume Screening Web App built with Streamlit that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automatically classify resumes into predefined job categories. It simulates an intelligent HR assistant that can analyze text from resumes and predict relevant job roles.

Features of this project:
1. Upload resumes in .txt or .pdf format

2.  Automatically clean and preprocess resume text

3.  Use TF-IDF vectorization to extract features from resume text

4.  Predict resume category using a trained classification model (e.g., SVM or Random Forest)

5.  Display predicted category on the Streamlit web interface
